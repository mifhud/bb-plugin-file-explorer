/**
 * Drives the chat path scanner, which needs RPC and a thread.
 *
 * `threadId` arrives as a prop from the thread header action rather than from
 * the URL or a context hook. Parsing `/threads/<id>` out of `location` was a
 * guess about the desktop app's routing, and when it did not match the
 * scanner never started at all.
 *
 * A new `rpc` or `navigate` identity remounts this effect. The scanner keeps
 * its verdicts in a module cache keyed by `threadId`, so that remount does
 * not ask the server about paths it already resolved. Another thread has its
 * own key: the same string may exist in one workspace and not in another.
